## Technical Architecture

### System Overview

The College Assignment Assistant employs a modern client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Frontend Layer**: A responsive Next.js web application that provides the user interface and manages client-side state.

2. **Backend Services**: Python-based services that handle business logic, voice processing, and integration with external APIs.

3. **Integration Layer**: Connectors to external services like Google Classroom API (planned for future implementation).

4. **Voice Processing Pipeline**: A sophisticated pipeline that handles speech recognition, natural language processing, and text-to-speech conversion.

This architecture provides a foundation that is both scalable and maintainable, allowing for future enhancements and additional integration points.

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing optimal performance and SEO benefits. Key components include:

#### Technologies Used:
- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and routing
- **React**: For component-based UI development
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For efficient, utility-first styling
- **LiveKit Client SDK**: For real-time communication capabilities

#### Component Structure:
The frontend follows a component-based architecture with clear separation between:

- **Layout Components**: Define the overall structure of the application
- **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements
- **Feature Components**: Implement specific functionality
- **Hook Components**: Manage state and logic

Key components include:
- `TranscriptionView`: Displays real-time transcription of user speech
- `NoAgentNotification`: Provides feedback when the voice agent is not connected
- `VoiceAssistantControlBar`: Controls for the voice interaction

The frontend uses React hooks extensively for state management and side effects:
- `useCombinedTranscriptions`: Aggregates transcriptions from the user and agent
- `useLocalMicTrack`: Manages microphone input for voice recognition

### Detailed Frontend Component Architecture

The frontend architecture of the College Assignment Assistant is built on a carefully designed component system that balances modularity, reusability, and performance. This section provides an in-depth examination of key components, their interactions, and the technical considerations behind their implementation.

#### Core Component Hierarchy

The application's component hierarchy follows a structured approach to managing complexity:

```
RootLayout
└── Page
    ├── RoomContext.Provider
    │   └── SimpleVoiceAssistant
    │       ├── TranscriptionView
    │       ├── RoomAudioRenderer
    │       ├── NoAgentNotification
    │       └── ControlBar
    │           ├── BarVisualizer
    │           ├── VoiceAssistantControlBar
    │           └── DisconnectButton
    └── ConnectionDetails API
```

This hierarchy enables clear separation of concerns while facilitating data flow between interrelated components. Each component has a well-defined responsibility:

1. **RootLayout (`app/layout.tsx`)**: Provides global styling and font configurations, establishing the base HTML structure.

2. **Page Component (`app/page.tsx`)**: The main entry point that handles room initialization and connection management.

3. **RoomContext.Provider**: A React context that shares the LiveKit Room instance among all child components.

4. **SimpleVoiceAssistant**: Orchestrates the core voice assistant experience, including UI state management.

5. **TranscriptionView**: Renders real-time transcriptions from both the user and the assistant.

6. **ControlBar**: Manages the audio visualization, control buttons, and connection state feedback.

#### Room Initialization and Connection Flow

The room initialization process in the Page component demonstrates a sophisticated approach to establishing WebRTC connections:

```typescript
const [room] = useState(new Room());

const onConnectButtonClicked = useCallback(async () => {
  const url = new URL(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_CONN_DETAILS_ENDPOINT ?? "/api/connection-details",
    window.location.origin
  );
  const response = await fetch(url.toString());
  const connectionDetailsData: ConnectionDetails = await response.json();

  await room.connect(connectionDetailsData.serverUrl, connectionDetailsData.participantToken);
  await room.localParticipant.setMicrophoneEnabled(true);
}, [room]);
```

This implementation:

1. Creates a persistent Room instance using React's useState
2. Defines a memoized callback function that:
   - Fetches connection details from a configurable endpoint
   - Establishes a WebRTC connection with the LiveKit server
   - Enables the user's microphone for audio capture

This pattern ensures that connection resources are properly managed and that the connection process can be triggered declaratively from user interactions.

#### Responsive UI State Management

The SimpleVoiceAssistant component demonstrates sophisticated state management using the AnimatePresence component from Framer Motion:

```tsx
<AnimatePresence>
  {agentState === "disconnected" && (
    <motion.button
      initial={{ opacity: 0, top: 0 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
      exit={{ opacity: 0, top: "-10px" }}
      transition={{ duration: 1, ease: [0.09, 1.04, 0.245, 1.055] }}
      className="uppercase absolute left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 px-4 py-2 bg-white text-black rounded-md"
      onClick={() => props.onConnectButtonClicked()}
    >
      Start a conversation
    </motion.button>
  )}
  <div className="w-3/4 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto h-full">
    <TranscriptionView />
  </div>
</AnimatePresence>
```

This implementation:

1. Uses conditional rendering based on agentState to show/hide the connection button
2. Applies smooth animations for component mounting and unmounting
3. Uses custom easing functions to create polished motion effects
4. Ensures the UI remains responsive to state changes

The animation approach creates a more engaging user experience while maintaining clear visual feedback about the system's state.

#### Audio Visualization System

The ControlBar component integrates LiveKit's audio visualization capabilities with custom styling:

```tsx
<BarVisualizer
  state={agentState}
  barCount={5}
  trackRef={audioTrack}
  className="agent-visualizer w-24 gap-2"
  options={{ minHeight: 12 }}
/>
```

This visualization:

1. Receives the assistant's audio track to analyze audio levels
2. Renders a configurable number of vertical bars that respond to audio intensity
3. Applies custom styling through Tailwind CSS classes and custom CSS variables
4. Adapts its appearance based on the agent's state (listening, thinking, speaking)

Custom CSS in globals.css further enhances the visualization:

```css
:root {
  --lk-va-bar-width: 72px;
  --lk-control-bar-height: unset;
}

.agent-visualizer > .lk-audio-bar {
  width: 72px;
}
```

This approach creates a visually appealing feedback mechanism that helps users understand when the assistant is actively speaking or processing their input.

#### Accessibility Considerations in Component Design

The NoAgentNotification component exemplifies the project's commitment to accessibility and user feedback:

```tsx
{showNotification ? (
  <div className="fixed text-sm left-1/2 max-w-[90vw] -translate-x-1/2 flex top-6 items-center gap-4 bg-[#1F1F1F] px-4 py-3 rounded-lg">
    <div>
      {/* Warning Icon SVG */}
    </div>
    <p className="text-pretty w-max">
      It&apos;s quiet... too quiet. Is your agent lost? Ensure your agent is properly
      configured and running on your machine.
    </p>
    <a
      href="https://docs.livekit.io/agents/quickstarts/s2s/"
      target="_blank"
      className="underline whitespace-nowrap"
    >
      View guide
    </a>
    <button onClick={() => setShowNotification(false)}>
      {/* Close Icon SVG */}
    </button>
  </div>
) : null}
```

This implementation:

1. Provides clear, human-readable feedback when connection issues occur
2. Includes a visual warning icon to draw attention to the notification
3. Offers a direct link to documentation for troubleshooting
4. Allows users to dismiss the notification when no longer needed
5. Uses accessible markup with appropriate contrast ratios

The component's logic includes a sophisticated timeout mechanism that gives the system adequate time to establish a connection before displaying the notification:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (props.state === "connecting") {
    timeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
      if (props.state === "connecting" && agentHasConnected.current === false) {
        setShowNotification(true);
      }
    }, timeToWaitMs);
  } else {
    // Clear timeout and hide notification for other states
  }
  // ...cleanup function
}, [props.state]);
```

This approach prevents premature error messages while ensuring users aren't left wondering about connection issues.

#### Tailwind CSS Integration

The project makes extensive use of Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging utility classes to create a responsive and consistent design:

```tsx
<main data-lk-theme="default" className="h-full grid content-center bg-[var(--lk-bg)]">
  <RoomContext.Provider value={room}>
    <div className="lk-room-container max-h-[90vh]">
      <SimpleVoiceAssistant onConnectButtonClicked={onConnectButtonClicked} />
    </div>
  </RoomContext.Provider>
</main>
```

The integration with LiveKit's theming system is achieved through:

1. Custom CSS variables that override LiveKit defaults
2. Extension of LiveKit's component styles through Tailwind classes
3. Responsive design patterns that adapt to different screen sizes
4. Consistent color and spacing schemes throughout the application

This approach results in a cohesive design language that feels natural and intuitive while maintaining the technical capabilities required for complex real-time interactions.

### Backend Architecture

The backend system is built with Python, leveraging the LiveKit Agents framework for voice processing and interaction management. The system uses a pipeline-based approach to handle voice input, process it, and generate appropriate responses.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Python 3.9+**: Core programming language
- **LiveKit Agents**: Framework for voice interaction
- **Deepgram**: For Speech-to-Text (STT) processing
- **Google's Gemini AI**: For natural language understanding and response generation
- **Cartesia**: For Text-to-Speech (TTS) conversion
- **Silero VAD**: For voice activity detection

#### Voice Processing Pipeline:
The backend implements a sophisticated pipeline for voice interaction:
1. **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Identifies when a user is speaking
2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts spoken language to text
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands user intent and extracts relevant information
4. **Response Generation**: Creates appropriate responses based on user input
5. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts text responses back to natural-sounding speech

This pipeline enables fluid, natural conversation between the user and the assistant, creating a more engaging and efficient user experience.

### Voice Assistant Implementation

The voice assistant is implemented using the VoicePipelineAgent from LiveKit, which orchestrates the various components of the voice interaction system:

```python
agent = VoicePipelineAgent(
    vad=ctx.proc.userdata["vad"],
    stt=deepgram.STT(),
    llm=google.LLM(
      model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",
      temperature="0.8",
    ),
    tts=cartesia.TTS(),
    turn_detector=turn_detector.EOUModel(),
    min_endpointing_delay=0.5,
    max_endpointing_delay=5.0,
    noise_cancellation=noise_cancellation.BVC(),
    chat_ctx=initial_ctx,
)
```

This implementation includes:
- **Voice Activity Detection (VAD)**: Using Silero's pre-trained models
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Deepgram for accurate transcription
- **Language Model (LLM)**: Google's Gemini for understanding and generating responses
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Cartesia for natural-sounding voice output
- **Turn Detection**: Automated detection of when a user has finished speaking
- **Noise Cancellation**: Background voice and noise cancellation for improved clarity

The assistant is configured with a system prompt that defines its behavior and response style, ensuring it provides concise, helpful responses appropriate for a voice interface.

### Backend-Frontend Communication Flow

The real-time communication between the frontend and backend components represents one of the most sophisticated aspects of the College Assignment Assistant. This section provides a detailed examination of the communication flow, protocols, and technical considerations that enable the seamless voice interaction experience.

#### WebRTC-Based Communication Protocol

The College Assignment Assistant leverages WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology through the LiveKit platform to establish low-latency, high-quality audio streams between the user's browser and the backend voice processing system:

```
┌─────────────┐     WebRTC      ┌──────────┐      Internal      ┌─────────────┐
│  Browser    │  Audio Stream   │  LiveKit  │   Communication   │   Backend   │
│  Frontend   │ ◄────────────► │  Server   │ ◄───────────────► │   Services  │
└─────────────┘                 └──────────┘                    └─────────────┘
```

1. **Secure Signaling Process**:
   - When a user initiates a conversation by clicking "Start a conversation", the frontend generates a request to `/api/connection-details` endpoint
   - The endpoint creates a unique room name and participant identity
   - An AccessToken with appropriate grants is generated using the LiveKit Server SDK
   - The token is returned to the frontend along with connection parameters

2. **Connection Establishment**:
   - The frontend connects to the LiveKit server using the provided token
   - The backend agent connects to the same room using the LiveKit Agents SDK
   - Both parties establish peer connections through the LiveKit infrastructure

3. **Audio Stream Management**:
   - The frontend captures the user's microphone input using the `useLocalMicTrack` hook
   - Audio data is encoded and transmitted via WebRTC to the LiveKit server
   - The backend receives the audio stream and processes it through the voice pipeline

4. **Transcription and Response Flow**:
   - The backend processes audio through the VAD → STT → LLM → TTS pipeline
   - Transcriptions and responses are sent back to the frontend as WebRTC data channel messages
   - The frontend renders these messages in real-time using the TranscriptionView component

5. **State Synchronization**:
   - The backend agent publishes state changes (listening, thinking, speaking)
   - The frontend subscribes to these state changes via the `useVoiceAssistant` hook
   - UI elements respond accordingly (e.g., visualizer activates, interface updates)

In practice, this communication flow enables latency as low as 100-300ms from the end of user speech to the beginning of the assistant's response, creating a natural conversation experience that feels responsive and engaging.

#### Authentication and Connection Security

All communications between the frontend and backend are secured through multiple layers of protection:

1. **Token-Based Authentication**:
   - Each connection requires a cryptographically signed JWT token
   - Tokens include specific grants limiting what actions the participant can perform
   - Tokens are time-limited (15-minute expiration) to minimize security risks

2. **Secure WebSocket Connections**:
   - All WebSocket connections use WSS (WebSocket Secure) protocol
   - TLS/SSL encryption protects all data in transit
   - Connection parameters are never exposed in client-side code

3. **Room Isolation**:
   - Each user session creates a unique room with random identifiers
   - Cross-session data leakage is prevented by design
   - Backend agents only process data from their assigned rooms

The implementation in `app/api/connection-details/route.ts` demonstrates how these security measures are applied:

```typescript
// Generate participant token
const participantIdentity = `voice_assistant_user_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;
const roomName = `voice_assistant_room_${Math.floor(Math.random() * 10_000)}`;
const participantToken = await createParticipantToken(
  { identity: participantIdentity },
  roomName
);

// Token generation with specific grants
function createParticipantToken(userInfo: AccessTokenOptions, roomName: string) {
  const at = new AccessToken(API_KEY, API_SECRET, {
    ...userInfo,
    ttl: "15m",  // Time-limited token
  });
  const grant: VideoGrant = {
    room: roomName,
    roomJoin: true,
    canPublish: true,
    canPublishData: true,
    canSubscribe: true,
  };
  at.addGrant(grant);
  return at.toJwt();
}
```

#### Data Flow During Voice Interaction

The data flow during a typical voice interaction progresses through several stages, each with specific technical considerations:

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   ```

      │                                         │
   ```

3. **Processing and Response Phase**:
   ```
   Frontend                                  Backend
      │                                         │
      │                                         ├─ Turn detector signals completion
      │                                         │

      ├─ Play audio response                    │
      │                                         │
      ├─ Display assistant transcription        │
      │                                         │
   ```

This intricate dance of data between frontend and backend components happens in near real-time, creating a seamless conversational experience for the user while handling complex processing in the background.

#### Error Handling and Resilience

The communication system includes sophisticated error handling to ensure a robust user experience:

1. **Connection Recovery**:
   - WebRTC connections automatically attempt to reconnect after network interruptions
   - The frontend monitors connection state and provides appropriate feedback to users
   - Backend systems maintain session state to resume conversations after reconnection

2. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - If high-quality audio streaming isn't possible, the system can fall back to lower bitrates
   - When backend services experience high load, request queuing ensures responsiveness
   - If specific pipeline components fail (e.g., STT service outage), appropriate error messages guide the user

3. **User Feedback Mechanisms**:
   - The `NoAgentNotification` component detects when backend agents fail to connect within 10 seconds
   - Clear error messages direct users to appropriate troubleshooting steps
   - Connection state is reflected in the UI to maintain transparency

The implementation in `components/NoAgentNotification.tsx` demonstrates this approach:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  if (props.state === "connecting") {
    timeoutRef.current = window.setTimeout(() => {
      if (props.state === "connecting" && agentHasConnected.current === false) {
        setShowNotification(true);
      }
    }, timeToWaitMs);
  } else {
    if (timeoutRef.current) {
      window.clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
    }
    setShowNotification(false);
  }

  return () => {
    if (timeoutRef.current) {
      window.clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current);
    }
  };
}, [props.state]);
```

#### Real-World Performance Considerations

In real-world deployment, several factors influence the communication performance between frontend and backend:
